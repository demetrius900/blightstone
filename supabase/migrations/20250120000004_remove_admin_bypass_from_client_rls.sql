-- üîí SECURITY: Remove Admin Bypass from Client Data RLS Policies

-- COMMENT: Security Audit Trail
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- This migration enforces strict data isolation by:
-- 1. Removing admin bypass from all client data access
-- 2. Creating separate admin policies for admin endpoints only
-- 3. Ensuring clients can only see their own organization data
-- 4. Requiring admins to use dedicated admin endpoints with audit trails
--
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: After this migration:
-- - Admins will NOT be able to access client data via client endpoints
-- - Admin access must go through /api/admin/* endpoints only
-- - All admin actions should be logged for compliance
-- - Client dashboards will be completely isolated from admin access
--
