## 🎯 **Ready for Real APIs**

The implementation is designed to easily swap mock data for real APIs:

1. **Replace Mock Store**: Swap `mockBusinessStore` with real API calls
2. **Keep UI Components**: All components work with real data
3. **Maintain Events**: Replace custom events with WebSocket/polling
4. **Add Authentication**: Components already check for auth context

This creates a **fully functional demo experience** that showcases the complete business → ad account workflow without needing any backend APIs!
