# Frontend Integration Summary - Session 2

## 🎯 **Objective Completed**
Successfully continued the integration of the redesigned frontend from `adhub-accounts-page` directory, focusing on advanced functionality and settings components.

## ✅ **Major Accomplishments**

### 1. **Status Component System Refactoring** 🔧
**Problem Solved**: StatusBadge and StatusDot components were causing frequent TypeScript errors due to inconsistent type definitions.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created centralized status system in `src/lib/status-types.ts`
- Unified all status types and configurations in one place
- Updated both StatusBadge and StatusDot to use centralized system
- Added status normalization and fallback handling
- Eliminated type conflicts across the application

**Files Created/Updated**:
- `frontend/src/lib/status-types.ts` - Centralized status system
- `frontend/src/components/ui/status-badge.tsx` - Refactored component
- `frontend/src/components/ui/status-dot.tsx` - Refactored component
- `frontend/STATUS_COMPONENTS_REFACTOR.md` - Documentation

### 2. **Advanced Account Management Dialogs** 💰
**New Functionality Added**:

#### Account Transactions Dialog
- View detailed transaction history for individual accounts
- Summary cards showing current balance, total top-ups, and withdrawals
- Transaction list with status badges, descriptions, and references
- Empty state handling
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/account-transactions-dialog.tsx`

#### Withdraw Balance Dialog
- Withdraw funds from ad accounts back to main balance
- Real-time transaction preview
- Quick percentage buttons (25%, 50%, 75%, All)
- Warning system for large withdrawals
- Success state with confirmation
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/withdraw-balance-dialog.tsx`

### 3. **Enhanced Accounts Table Integration** 📊
**Updated**: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/accounts-table.tsx`
- Integrated new transaction history dialog
- Added withdraw balance functionality
- Enhanced dropdown menu with new actions
- Proper type handling for dialog interactions

### 4. **Settings System Implementation** ⚙️
**New Settings Infrastructure**:

#### Settings Layout

- Connected accounts (Google integration)
- Danger zone for account deletion
- **Files**: 
  - `frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/account/page.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/settings/account-settings.tsx`

### 5. **Data Integration Consistency** 🔄
- All new components use centralized mock data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
- Proper type conversions between different account formats
- Consistent financial data integration
- Maintained single source of truth principle
