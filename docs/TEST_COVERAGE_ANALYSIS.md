## Conclusion

The current test suite is essentially a "smoke test" - it verifies that pages load and redirect correctly, but doesn't test any of the actual business value of your application. To have confidence in your system, you need to test the complete user workflows that generate revenue and provide value to your customers.

The comprehensive test suite I've outlined above would give you real confidence that your application works as expected and won't break when you deploy changes.
