## 🛠️ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Payment Integration (2 hours)

```typescript
// Stripe integration for client top-ups
const handleTopUp = async (amount: number) => {
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
    currency: 'usd',
    metadata: { userId, type: 'wallet_topup' }
  })
  
  // Record transaction + apply fee
  const fee = Math.max(amount * 0.025, 0.50)
  const netAmount = amount - fee
  
  await updateWalletBalance(userId, netAmount)
  await recordTransaction({ amount, fee, netAmount, type: 'topup' })
}
```

### 2. Fee Logic (2 hours)

```typescript
// Fee calculation system
interface FeeStructure {
  transactionFeeRate: 0.025 // 2.5%
  minimumFee: 0.50
  monthlyFee?: 29.99 // Optional subscription
}

const calculateFee = (amount: number) => {
  return Math.max(amount * FeeStructure.transactionFeeRate, FeeStructure.minimumFee)
}

// Apply fees to all transactions
const processTopUpRequest = async (requestId: string, amount: number) => {
  const fee = calculateFee(amount)
  const netAmount = amount - fee
  
  // Deduct from client wallet, add to ad account
  await transferFunds(clientId, adAccountId, netAmount)
  await recordRevenue(fee)
}
```

### 3. Client Business Flow (2 hours)

**Already 90% Built - Just Need:**
- [ ] Connect registration to production auth
- [ ] Link business creation to approval workflow
- [ ] Connect wallet top-up to Stripe
- [ ] Enable top-up request submission

### 4. Admin System & Dolphin Integration (2 hours)

```typescript
// Dolphin Cloud API integration
const pullFacebookAssets = async (businessManagerId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${DOLPHIN_API_URL}/accounts`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${DOLPHIN_API_KEY}` }
  })
  
  const accounts = await response.json()
  return accounts.filter(acc => acc.business_manager_id === businessManagerId)
}

// Asset binding system
const bindAssetToClient = async (clientId: string, fbAccountId: string) => {
  await supabase.from('client_accounts').insert({
    client_id: clientId,
    facebook_account_id: fbAccountId,
    status: 'active',
    created_at: new Date()
  })
}
```

## 💡 The Real Workflow

**Client Side:**
1. Register account ✅ (already built)
2. Create business application ✅ (already built) 
3. Top up wallet (connect to Stripe)
4. Submit top-up requests ✅ (already built)

**Admin Side:**
1. Review business applications ✅ (already built)
2. Pull Facebook assets from Dolphin Cloud
3. Bind assets to approved clients
4. Process top-up requests ✅ (already built)

**System Side:**
1. Calculate fees on all transactions
2. Record revenue
3. Handle payment processing
4. Send notifications

This is actually **much simpler** than the original plan - most of the UI and workflow already exists! We just need to connect the payment processing and Dolphin Cloud integration.
