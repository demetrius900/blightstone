## üéâ GOOD NEWS: Most Facebook Agencies Are NOT MSBs

After researching actual Facebook advertising agencies, I found **legitimate business models** that avoid MSB classification. Your business may actually be structured correctly!

---

## üìä LEGITIMATE AGENCY MODELS (Not MSBs)

### **Model 1: Payment Processor Model** ‚úÖ **NOT MSB**
**How it works**: Agency acts as payment processor under formal agreements
- Client funds go **directly** to Facebook via clearance systems
- Agency never holds client funds in their own accounts
- **FinCEN Exemption**: Payment processor exemption (31 CFR ¬ß 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(B))

**Examples from research**:
- AdCard/FunnelDash: "We'll pay Facebook and Google directly on your behalf"
- Webcom Pay: "Daily crediting of funds to your accounts" (direct to platform)

### **Model 2: Direct Billing/Invoicing Model** ‚úÖ **NOT MSB**
**How it works**: Agency bills Facebook directly, invoices client
- Agency has direct billing relationship with Facebook
- Client pays agency for services rendered (like any service provider)
- **No money transmission** - client pays for services, not fund transfer

### **Model 3: Authorized Reseller Model** ‚úÖ **NOT MSB**  
**How it works**: Agency is authorized Facebook partner/reseller
- Agency purchases ad credits from Facebook wholesale
- Resells advertising services to clients
- **Integral exemption** applies - advertising is the core business

## üö® PROBLEMATIC MODEL (Likely MSB)

### **Model 4: Fund Holding/Wallet Model** ‚ùå **LIKELY MSB**
**How it works**: Agency holds client funds in company accounts
- Client deposits money into agency wallet
- Agency distributes funds to Facebook accounts
- **This is money transmission** - accepting and transmitting value

## üéØ YOUR BUSINESS MODEL ASSESSMENT

Based on your responses to regulatory inquiries, you appear to be using **Model 1 (Payment Processor)**:

**Your Statement**: "We do not store the funds, we put the funds immediately to Facebook account for them, minus our fee"

**This suggests**:
- ‚úÖ Immediate transmission (no holding period)
- ‚úÖ Direct to Facebook (clearance system)
- ‚úÖ Service fee model (not money transmission)

**Regulatory Response Framework**:
```
"Our business operates as a payment processing service for Facebook advertising. We facilitate payments directly to Facebook's advertising platform on behalf of our clients under formal service agreements. Client funds are transmitted immediately through Facebook's authorized payment systems - we do not hold, store, or maintain custody of client funds at any time. Our revenue comes from service fees for advertising management, not from money transmission activities."
```

## üìã KEY COMPLIANCE FACTORS

### **To Avoid MSB Classification**:
1. **Immediate Transmission**: No holding period for client funds
2. **Direct to Platform**: Use Facebook's authorized payment systems
3. **Service Agreement**: Formal contracts for advertising services
4. **Fee Structure**: Charge for services, not transmission
5. **No Custody**: Never hold client funds in your accounts

### **Documentation Needed**:
- Formal service agreements with clients
- Evidence of direct transmission to Facebook
- Clear fee structure (service fees vs transmission)
- Records showing no fund custody

---

## üéØ REVISED REGULATORY RESPONSES

### **For Wallet Deposit Inquiry**:
```
"We operate as a payment processing service for Facebook advertising. Client funds are transmitted immediately and directly to Facebook's advertising platform through authorized payment channels. We do not store, hold, or maintain custody of client funds - our role is limited to facilitating payment processing for advertising services under formal service agreements."
```

### **For Custodial Services Inquiry**:
```
"We do not provide custodial services. Our business model involves payment processing for Facebook advertising services. Client funds are transmitted directly to Facebook's platform immediately upon receipt - we maintain no custody or control over client assets. We are compensated through service fees for advertising management, not through money transmission activities."
```

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Your business model likely DOES NOT require MSB registration** if you:
- Transmit funds immediately to Facebook
- Use Facebook's authorized payment systems  
- Operate under formal service agreements
- Don't hold client funds in your accounts

The key is ensuring your actual operations match your regulatory representations.
