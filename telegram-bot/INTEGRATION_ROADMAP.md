---

## üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### 1. **Dolphin Cloud API Issues**

**Problem**: Authentication failing (401 Unauthorized)

**Questions to Answer**:
- ‚ùì Is the Dolphin Cloud token format correct?
- ‚ùì Do we need special headers or authentication method?
- ‚ùì Are we using the right API endpoints?
- ‚ùì Do we need to whitelist IP addresses?

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Verify Dolphin Cloud token is valid and has correct permissions
- [ ] Check Dolphin Cloud documentation for proper authentication
- [ ] Test API calls directly (Postman/curl) to isolate the issue
- [ ] Contact Dolphin Cloud support if needed

### 2. **Payment Processing Integration**

**Problem**: No payment processor integrated for wallet top-ups

**Requirements Clarified**:
‚úÖ Payment Methods: Binance, Stripe, Bank Transfer
‚úÖ Payment Flow: Telegram payments for bot users, website for web users  
‚úÖ Workflow: Funds ‚Üí Client wallet balance ‚Üí Individual account top-ups
‚úÖ Manual Business Manager connection to Dolphin Cloud (done by you)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement Stripe integration for Telegram payments
- [ ] Add Binance Pay integration 
- [ ] Design bank transfer verification system
- [ ] Create payment webhooks for instant balance updates
- [ ] Build account selection UI for top-ups from wallet balance

### 3. **Dolphin Cloud Workflow Understanding**

**Problem**: Don't understand the complete workflow

**Questions to Answer**:
- ‚ùì How do you currently connect Business Managers to Dolphin Cloud?
- ‚ùì What's the process for adding new ad accounts?
- ‚ùì How does the top-up process actually work?
- ‚ùì What data do you get from Dolphin Cloud vs store locally?

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Document current Dolphin Cloud setup process
- [ ] Map out data flow between your platform and Dolphin Cloud
- [ ] Test top-up process manually to understand the workflow
- [ ] Create integration documentation

## üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES**

### 4. **Error Handling & Monitoring**

**Current State**: Basic error handling exists but not comprehensive

**Needs**:
- [ ] Proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Alert system for failed operations
- [ ] Graceful degradation when APIs are down
- [ ] User-friendly error messages

### 5. **Security & Permissions**

**Current State**: Basic role checking implemented

**Needs**:
- [ ] Rate limiting for bot commands
- [ ] Audit logging for financial operations
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for large top-ups
- [ ] IP whitelisting for admin operations

‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Account linking works
‚úÖ **Permission System**: Role-based access implemented

## üéØ **QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

**Immediate (This Week)**:
1. Can you share a working Dolphin Cloud API call (Postman collection export)?
2. What's your current process for topping up ad accounts manually?
3. Do you have access to Dolphin Cloud support/documentation?

**Strategic (Next Week)**:
1. What payment processors do you currently use on your main platform?
2. Should wallet top-ups happen in Telegram or redirect to your website?
3. What's your budget for payment processing fees?

**Operational**:
1. Who will be the admin users for the bot?
2. What are your expected transaction volumes?
3. Do you need multi-currency support?

## üí° **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

1. **Don't launch yet** - Fix critical issues first
2. **Start with Dolphin Cloud** - This is the core functionality
3. **Simple payment flow** - Web-based initially, can enhance later
4. **Gradual rollout** - Test with small group first

**Timeline Estimate**: 2-3 weeks to production-ready bot

Would you like to tackle the Dolphin Cloud issue first, or should we focus on understanding your current payment workflow?
