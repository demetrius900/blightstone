# ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE STAGING DEPLOYMENT PLAN

## Objective
Deploy current fully-functional demo to `staging.adhub.tech` to preserve sales demo while we integrate real backend logic.

## Why This is Critical
- **Sales Demo**: Current frontend is perfect for client presentations
- **Development Safety**: Allows us to experiment with real backend integration without losing demo
- **Parallel Development**: Can work on production integration while keeping demo alive

## Immediate Steps

### 1. Update Staging Configuration
- Modify `render-staging.yaml` to use current demo configuration
- Ensure frontend uses mock data in staging environment
- Set up separate database for staging if needed

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
```bash
# Staging Frontend (.env.staging)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://adhub-backend-staging.onrender.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true

# Staging Backend
ENVIRONMENT=staging
DATABASE_URL=<staging_db_url>
CORS_ORIGINS=https://staging.adhub.tech
```

### 3. Deploy to Render
- Use existing `render-staging.yaml` configuration
- Deploy all three services:
  - Frontend (with mock data)
  - Backend (real APIs for future use)
  - Telegram Bot (separate staging instance)

### 4. DNS Configuration
- Point `staging.adhub.tech` to Render frontend service
- Ensure SSL certificate is properly configured

## Timeline
- **Setup**: 30 minutes
- **Deployment**: 15 minutes  
- **Testing**: 15 minutes
- **Total**: 1 hour

## Success Criteria
- âœ… `staging.adhub.tech` shows current demo functionality
- âœ… All admin panel features work with mock data
- âœ… Client dashboard functions properly
- âœ… Sales team can use for presentations
- âœ… Production domain remains untouched for development

## Next Phase
Once staging is live, we can safely integrate real backend APIs into production domain without losing demo functionality.
