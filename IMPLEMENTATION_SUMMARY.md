### 2. 🏢 Organization Creation Logic
**Status: ✅ Complete**

#### Implementation:
- **Automatic Organization Creation:** New users get a default organization during signup
- **Complete Setup:** Organization + membership + wallet creation in single transaction
- **Proper Database Relations:** Correct `auth.users` references and foreign keys

#### Code Changes:
- **File:** `backend/api/endpoints/auth.py`
- **Enhancement:** Modified registration endpoint to create:
  1. User profile in `profiles` table
  2. Default organization in `organizations` table
  3. User membership in `organization_members` table
  4. Default wallet in `wallets` table

#### Default Naming:
- Organization name: `"{user_name}'s Organization"` or `"{email}'s Organization"`
- Plan: `starter` (default)

### 3. 🔗 Business ↔ Business Manager Mapping System
**Status: ✅ Complete**

#### Database Schema:
**New Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20250117000000_add_business_manager_mapping.sql`

Added to `businesses` table:
- `facebook_business_manager_id` (TEXT) - Facebook BM ID
- `facebook_business_manager_name` (TEXT) - Display name
- `facebook_business_manager_assigned_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Assignment date
- `facebook_business_manager_assigned_by` (UUID) - Admin who assigned

#### API Endpoints:
**File:** `backend/api/endpoints/businesses.py`

- `POST /{business_id}/assign-business-manager` - Assign BM to business
- `DELETE /{business_id}/business-manager` - Remove BM assignment

#### Business Logic:
- **1:1 Mapping:** Each Business Manager can only be assigned to one business
- **Permission Control:** Only organization admins/owners and superusers can assign
- **Conflict Prevention:** Prevents duplicate BM assignments
- **Audit Trail:** Tracks who assigned what and when

#### Schema Updates:
**File:** `backend/schemas/business.py`
- Added BM fields to `BusinessRead` schema
- Created `BusinessManagerAssignment` and `BusinessManagerAssignmentResponse` schemas

#### Strategy:
- **Staging Environment:** `staging.adhub.tech` for partner demos
- **Production Environment:** `adhub.tech` for development
- **Separate Services:** Backend, Frontend, and Telegram Bot for staging
- **Environment Isolation:** Separate databases and bot tokens
