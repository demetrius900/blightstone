1. **Choose Your Plan** ‚ùå (incomplete)

## Current Onboarding Progress API

The system tracks:
- `hasSelectedPlan`: false (user needs to choose a paid plan)
- `hasVerifiedEmail`: true (if auto-confirm is enabled)
- `hasFundedWallet`: false (user needs to add funds)
- `hasAppliedForBM`: false (user needs to submit application)

## Expected Behavior

- **Full-screen onboarding**: No topbar, no sidebar, just the onboarding experience
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Step navigation**: Click steps to expand/collapse details
- **Action buttons**: "Setup" buttons for incomplete steps
- **Dashboard restriction**: Can't access main dashboard until complete

## Test Email Confirmation (if needed)

If email confirmation is required:
1. Check your email for confirmation link
2. Click the link
3. Should redirect to `/onboarding` (not `/dashboard`)
4. Complete the remaining steps

## Notes

- The onboarding page is now a standalone experience
- Users can't access the main dashboard until onboarding is complete
- The flow matches your actual business model (no manual account creation)
- All steps are real and functional
