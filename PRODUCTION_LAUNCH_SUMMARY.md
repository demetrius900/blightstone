STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...                 # ← Production webhook
AIRWALLEX_CLIENT_ID=production_client_id        # ← Production Airwallex
AIRWALLEX_API_KEY=production_api_key           # ← Production Airwallex
DOLPHIN_API_KEY=production_dolphin_key         # ← Production Dolphin

### 🚨 Critical Path to Launch

1. **Day 1:** Environment setup and external service configuration
2. **Day 2:** Final testing and production deployment
3. **Launch:** Go live with monitoring

### 💡 Recommendations

**Before Launch:**
- Test one complete user journey in production environment
- Verify all webhook endpoints are working
- Confirm admin access and critical admin functions

**Post-Launch:**
- Monitor error rates closely for first 24 hours
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor payment processing success rates

### 🎉 Bottom Line

**AdHub is technically ready for production launch.** The application has been thoroughly tested, all critical features are implemented, and the codebase passes all quality checks. The remaining work is primarily operational setup (switching to production keys and services) rather than development work.

**Estimated Time to Launch: 1-2 days** (depending on external service setup speed)
