# Asset Deactivation Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Complete Implementation**

We have successfully implemented a client-controlled asset deactivation system that allows users to deactivate their business managers and ad accounts to free up pool slots without losing the assets.

## **Database Changes**

### 1. **New Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250120000030_add_client_asset_deactivation.sql`
- Added `is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true` to `asset_binding` table
- Updated `check_plan_limits()` function to only count active assets (`is_active = true`)
- Created `toggle_asset_activation()` function for safe status toggling
- Updated `get_organization_assets()` RPC function to include `is_active` field
- Added performance index: `idx_asset_binding_active_status`

### 2. **Pool Logic Updated**
- Only assets with `asset_binding.status = 'active'` AND `asset_binding.is_active = true` count toward plan limits
- Deactivated assets free up pool slots immediately
- Plan limit enforcement now considers both binding status and client activation status

## **API Endpoints**

### 1. **Asset Deactivation API**: `/api/assets/[assetId]/toggle-activation`
- `POST` endpoint for toggling asset activation status
- Validates user ownership of the asset
- Uses database function for safe status changes
- Returns updated asset information

### 2. **Updated APIs**
- `/api/business-managers` - now includes `is_active` field
- `/api/ad-accounts` - now includes `is_active` field  
- `/api/subscriptions/current` - usage counts exclude deactivated assets

## **Frontend Components**

### 1. **Hook**: `useAssetDeactivation`
- Manages deactivation/activation API calls
- Handles loading states and error handling
- Invalidates relevant SWR caches
- Shows success/error toast messages

### 2. **Dialog**: `AssetDeactivationDialog`
- User-friendly dialog for deactivation/activation
- Shows clear explanations of what happens
- Different messaging for BMs vs ad accounts
- Warns about pool slot usage/freeing

### 3. **Updated Business Managers Table**
- Added deactivation dropdown menu option
- Visual indicator for deactivated assets
- Filter option for deactivated assets
- Integration with deactivation dialog

## **Status Hierarchy**

```
Final Asset Functionality = asset.status + asset_binding.status + asset_binding.is_active

Examples:
✅ asset.status='active' + binding.status='active' + is_active=true = Fully functional
🟡 asset.status='active' + binding.status='active' + is_active=false = Visible but deactivated  
❌ asset.status='active' + binding.status='inactive' + is_active=true = Hidden (unbound)
🔴 asset.status='suspended' + binding.status='active' + is_active=true = Visible but Facebook suspended
```

## **User Experience**

### **For Clients:**
1. **Deactivate Assets**: Click dropdown → "Deactivate" → Confirm
2. **Free Pool Slots**: Deactivated assets don't count toward plan limits
3. **Reactivate Anytime**: Click dropdown → "Activate" → Confirm (if slots available)
4. **Visual Feedback**: Deactivated assets show "Deactivated" badge
5. **Filter Options**: Can filter to show only deactivated assets

### **For Business Logic:**
1. **Prevents Topups**: Deactivated assets can't receive wallet topups
2. **Blocks New Requests**: Can't request new ad accounts for deactivated BMs
3. **Pool Management**: Enables plan optimization without losing assets
4. **Reversible**: Can reactivate assets when needed

## **Key Benefits**

1. **🎯 Pool Optimization**: Clients can free up slots without losing assets
2. **💰 Cost Efficiency**: Better plan utilization and upgrade timing
3. **🔄 Flexibility**: Reversible deactivation for seasonal usage
4. **👥 User Control**: Clients manage their own asset activation
5. **📊 Clear Visibility**: Easy to see which assets are deactivated

## **Technical Implementation**

- **Database**: Clean separation of binding vs activation status
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with proper validation
- **Frontend**: React hooks and components with TypeScript
- **UX**: Clear dialogs and visual indicators
- **Performance**: Indexed queries and optimized RPC functions

This implementation provides a complete, user-friendly asset deactivation system that solves the pool management problem while maintaining data integrity and user experience.
